Cross platform navigation controller for Appcelerator Titanium.
It is a mobile app that displays a series of windows in an easily navigable stack.

This is my version of the Cross-Platform NavigationController written by
Kevin Whinnery and modified by Matthew Lanham. Their github repositories are,
respectively at, 
https://github.com/kwhinnery/NavigationController
https://github.com/appcelerator-developer-relations/Forging-Titanium/tree/master/ep-002
https://github.com/swanify/Titanium-Navigation-Controller

One of the challenges of Titanium is that it's still evolving, so older
versions of Titanium code don't compile with the latest SDK. I've merged
Kevin and Matthew's versions and cleaned up the code so that it compiles up to
Titanium Mobile 2.0.2GA SDK, is compatible with Google Android 2.3.3,
iPhone 5.1, and applies the CommonJS pattern.
